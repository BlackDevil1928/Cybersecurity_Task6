## 📚 Key Learnings

### ✅ What Makes a Password Strong:
- Length: Minimum 12–16 characters recommended
- Use of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Avoid using dictionary words or personal information
- No predictable patterns or reused passwords

### ❌ Common Mistakes:
- Using simple or reused passwords (e.g., `password123`)
- Including personal data like birthdates or names
- Keeping the same password for all accounts

## 🔐 Understanding Common Attacks

### 1. **Brute Force Attack**  
Tries all possible combinations. The shorter and simpler the password, the quicker it's cracked.

### 2. **Dictionary Attack**  
Uses a list of common words or passwords. Easily defeats passwords like `iloveyou`, `admin`, or `welcome123`.

### 3. **Credential Stuffing**  
Uses leaked passwords from one service to try access on others.

## 🛡️ Best Practices

- Use **passphrases** (e.g., `Sunset@Mountains#2025`)
- Use **unique passwords** for each service
- **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- Use **Password Managers** to generate/store strong passwords (e.g., Bitwarden, 1Password)
